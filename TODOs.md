# TODOs
##. SizeState 
- Take previous (Size, TimeTook) and then analyse to get next size


## Output
- Produce a graph time/size where time is tolerated/normalized for range of 1 to 10
- Size are not normalized
- Use coregraph to generate the graph. The graph can be used to verify the algorithm by humans  even if the analysis becomes insufficient.
